My name is Emilie and I am in the fourth year of a PhD in Speech and Audio processing in the [Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/). My work focuses on multichannel speech enhancement using classical array processing techniques such as beamforming and subspace-based methods. I am also part of an interdisciplinary project with the [University College London Dementia Research Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/dementia-research-centre) investigating links between hearing and dementia. 

I have recently worked to collect a [multi-media dataset of natural conversations in noise](https://ed1016.github.io/publication/2023_12_19_GIN) in collaboration with [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/uk/realitylabs/). Previously, I worked at [Nuance Communications (Microsoft)](https://www.nuance.com/en-gb/index.html) on data augmentation for automatic recognition of accented speech.

At Imperial College London, I am the vice-chair and treasurer of the [IEEE Student Branch](https://edu.ieee.org/uk-imperial/) which regularly organises seminars, panel discussions, or student conferences. I was also a postgraduate student representative and I worked to organise various social and technical events.
