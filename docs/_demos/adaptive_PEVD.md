subtitle: "Frame-based space-time covariance matrix estimation for PEVD-based speech enhancement"
---

This animation shows the beampatterns obtained through polynomial eigenvalue (PEVD) decomposition of the frame-based space-time covariance matrix estimate obtained following the procedure in [1].

The desired speech source is located at 90Â° and is corrupted by diffuse speech-shaped noise at 0 dB SNR.

Several values of &#945; are plotted, with larger values of &#945; showing smaller beam fluctuations with speech activity.
